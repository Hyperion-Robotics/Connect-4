This repository was created to aid with the development of the Autonomous Connect 4 system and is not meant to help someone recreate the project. Its purpose for being publicized is for interested people to look at the brains that run this system which was displayed on the 88th TIF in September of 2024. Over 1000 games were played and the system lost 15 of them with minimal problems.
